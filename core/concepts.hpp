/*
 * Arithmetic type predicate traits. 
 * 
 * A predicate trait is a special case of a type trait which acts as a boolean predicate which evaluates/checks a certain property of the type specified.
 * Default traits are defined as false boolean predicates, and optionally, with an error message (static_assert). User should register new types to fulfill a concept (Specialize the trait to true).
 * The library provides a set of macros to automatize the trait definition process.
